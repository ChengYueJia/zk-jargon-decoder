Shared inputs to both the prover and verifier of a [SNARK](./snark.md) that support the statement to be proven. Notice that a [Common Reference String](./common_reference_string.md) or [Structured Reference String](./structured_reference_string.md) are also shared by both the prover and verifier. However neither of these are specific to the statement and therefore are not part of the instance.
